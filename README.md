# hello-world
This is an educational exersize to get familiar with GitHub.
My name is Ron. I am an engineer, artist, creative thinker, hard worker, dreamer, believer and programmer. I should also add a splash of all sorts of other roles as well like dad, uncle, son, student, teacher. I am a perpetual student and I am happy to learn from others and to share what I have learned as well.
